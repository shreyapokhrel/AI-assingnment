#Q no.2 Improve the vacuum cleaning agentâ€™s efficiency by implementing a model-based agent
#A model-based vacuum cleaning agent maintains an internal representation of the environment, enabling it to make smarter decisions and avoid unnecessary actions.
#This approach is more efficient because the agent doesn't repeatedly visit clean areas or perform redundant cleaning.
#Instead, it remembers which areas are clean and focuses on dirty areas.
#Memory of the Environment:Tracks the state of all rooms.Avoids revisiting clean rooms unnecessarily.
#Planned Movement:Navigates intelligently based on known information.Reduces wasted moves and energy consumption.
#Adaptability:Adapts to dynamic changes in the environment (e.g., a room becoming dirty again).
